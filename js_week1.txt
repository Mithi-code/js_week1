Q-difference between copy by value and copy by reference:-
- : Copy By Value
In Copy by value the data which variable hold is passed to another variable .
 Both the variables refers two different memory locations.
ex:- var a = 20;
      var b = a ;
     b = 100;
console.log(a, b)
output:- 20, 100
In the above example,
For variable named(b) data which is present in the a is copied not value . 
Even if contents of 'b' are changed original variable value from which it is copied remain same.
-: Copy by reference
For composite data types objects are copied by reference. Actual variable and copied variable both
refer to same memory location . SO change in data of copied variable will lead to change in data of original variable too.
ex:- var a = [1,2,3]
         var b =a
         console.log(a,b)
output:- [1,2,3] , [1,2,3]
         b[2]= 100
       console.log(a,b)
output:- [1,2,100]   , [1,2,100]
In the above example we could notice that changing the value of 'b' lead to change of original variable from
which it is copied as they both refer same memory location.

Q- How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).
 - There are 3 ways to copy by value for composite data types.
1.Using the spread (...) operator
2.Using the Object.assign() method
3.Using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
